I'm a self-taught developer. I love playing all kinds of video games. At some point I became interested in mods while playing Ark Survival Evolved
I wanted to make a mod myself so I began to search how does one make mods for ARK. I came across Ark Dev Kit, which was powered by Unreal Engine, and managed to make my own mod.
Naturally Imy interests moved from the dev kit to the Unreal Engine itself and my journey as a "game developer" started.

As mentioned already I began to learn Unreal Engine 4 with blueprints. I learned a lot of by making different small projects that never saw the light of day.

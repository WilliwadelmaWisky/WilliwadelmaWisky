  I'm mostly a self-taught software developer and do programming as a hobby. I love learning new things and creating all kinds of projects including games. My interest in programing actually derives from the passion of playing video games. I wanted to learn how to make a game myself. I am also a linux user. I used to use windows in the past but decided to move to linux when the end of support of windows 10, "the last ever windows", was announced. Switching to linux was probably the best decision I could have made. I may have had to sacrifice a few of the games I like but that is a cost I can live with.

## My Developer Journey

<p align="justify">
  I became interested in modding while playing Ark Survival Evolved. I wanted to make a mod myself so I began to search how does one make mods for ARK. I came across Ark Dev Kit, which was powered by Unreal Engine, and managed to make my own mod after trial and error. There was actually very little resources on how the dev kit works at the time so I lost interest on it quite quickly. Also the fact that the dev kit ran extremely slowly on my machine encouraged that. Naturally my interests moved from the dev kit to the Unreal Engine itself and my journey as a "game developer" started.
</p>

> [!NOTE]
> I have used many different languages and frameworks during my journey, including some I could not fit in the categories below. The following "story" is not completely in chronological order.

### Game Development
![Unreal Engine](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Unreal%20Engine-313131?style=for-the-badge&logo=unreal-engine&logoColor=white)

<p align="justify">
  As mentioned already I began to learn Unreal Engine 4 with blueprints. I learned a lot of by making different small projects that never saw the light of day. However my inability to make something visually pleasing in 3D make me begin to lean towards the 2D development. The tooling for 2D in Unreal Engine was quite limited at the time so naturally I started to look for better alternatives. 
</p>

![Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unity-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=unity&logoColor=white)
![CSharp](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-239120?style=for-the-badge&logo=csharp&logoColor=white)

<p align="justify">
  I came across Unity, of which I had heard of before, and started to learn how to build something with it. Luckily there was a lot more learning material for Unity than for Unreal, so learning was not an issue. To be able to build something with Unity, I first needed to learn C#. It was such a different experience from blueprints in Unreal. Luckily C# syntax was very straight forward so I was able to understand it rather quickly. So I began building different 2D projects to learn the language better. I completely fell in love with C# and its statically typed language syntax. After many attempts to finish a game, I always ended up losing interest in the projects due to the gameplay not being fun enough or the quality of the assets not being eye-pleasing enough. In the end I had a lot of unfinished projects but had learned so much. The experience with Unity and C# definitely opened many doors to learn different languages.
</p>

### Web Development
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-222222?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)
![Vue](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vue-35495E?style=for-the-badge&logo=vuedotjs&logoColor=4FC08D)
![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)
![Javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E)

<p align="justify">
  At the start of my web application journey I came across a framework called React. I also heard it was quite popular so I gave it a try. The syntax was a lot different than that of C#, especially with reqular javascript. I decided to go with typescript which was definitely a wise decision. A few little projects, todo etc., later I thought react is a little bit unnecessary for my use-case. I began searching for another way. I decided to give another framework, called vue, a try because I heard people like it a lot more than react. I started to build a little login/logoff application with vue. Very quickly I realized that, even though I liked vue quite a bit, also vue was a bit unnecessary.
</p>

![JQuery](https://img.shields.io/badge/jquery-%230769AD.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=jquery&logoColor=white)
![Leaflet](https://img.shields.io/badge/Leaflet-199900.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Leaflet&logoColor=white)
![Javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E)

<p align="justify">
  Building something simple was a lot better to do with plain javascript than with react or vue for example. However plain javascript is a bit tedious and I image that is the main reason for choosing to use a framework. Luckily JQuery came to the rescue. I can keep my projects very simple and clean from all the boilerplate.
</p>

![LegacyReact](https://img.shields.io/badge/Legacy_React-2B2E3A.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)
![Babel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Babel-F9DC3e?style=for-the-badge&logo=babel&logoColor=black)
![Javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E)

<p align="justify">
  At some point I heard that it is possible to use react without nodejs. However the app did not work without a local server. So I decided to make a simple http server with go. I also made an http server with python. I really like the legacy framework for it having a lot less boilerplate. It is also made me understand better on how web servers work.

### Desktop Applications
![.Net](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET-5C2D91?style=for-the-badge&logo=.net&logoColor=white)
![CSharp](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-239120?style=for-the-badge&logo=csharp&logoColor=white)

<p align="justify">
  I got interested in desktop applications while developing prototypes with unity and visual studio.  
</p>

![Electron](https://img.shields.io/badge/Electron-2B2E3A?style=for-the-badge&logo=electron&logoColor=9FEAF9)
![Javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E)

<p align="justify">
  My first taste of web-based desktop application frameworks was electron. A working application was quite simple to get up and running with electron+javascript. However, in electron, wokring with for example a file system felt a little too complicated to my taste. I decided to search a different option.
</p>

![JavaFX](https://img.shields.io/badge/javafx-%23FF0000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javafx&logoColor=white)
![JUnit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Junit5-25A162?style=for-the-badge&logo=junit5&logoColor=white)
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)

<p align="justify">
  Now I have been using java for developing desktop applications and have not really looked back. Java is also very similar to C# so there was not too much to learn about the syntax. If only java had operator overloading it would be amazing. Nonetheless I can get stuff done and I am happy about it.
</p>

![Tauri](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tauri-1c1f24?style=for-the-badge&logo=Tauri&logoColor=FFC131)
![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-111111?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=E95420)

<p align="justify">
  I came across Tauri.
  However the problem with tauri was that I needed to learn rust. So I decided I would do just that and began learning rust. Rust was a very different experience from C# or javascript, and I little too complicated and messy to get something actually done. I decided to move away from web-based frameworks to java.
</p>

![PyQT5](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyQT5-%23217346.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Qt&logoColor=white)
![Pytest](https://img.shields.io/badge/pytest-%23ffffff.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=pytest&logoColor=2f9fe3)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

<p align="justify">
  I also tried building desktop apps with python. However that did not go very smoothly and the reason wasn't even python itself, nor my inability to use it. The problem was the ability to run python applications after making executables of them. I found a lot of similar issues where windows defender blocks the execution and deletes the file afterwards. Luckily there was an easy fix for that, ditching windows entirely. 
</p>

![OpenGL](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenGL-%23FFFFFF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=opengl)
![CMake](https://img.shields.io/badge/CMake-%23008FBA.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=cmake&logoColor=white)
![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)

<p align="justify">
  I have been getting into computer graphics a little bit lately in the form of C++ and OpenGL. GLFW for windows and CMake as a build system make a quite a powerrful combination.
</p>

### Data Science and Machine Learning
![Numpy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Numpy-777BB4?style=for-the-badge&logo=numpy&logoColor=white)
![Scipy](https://img.shields.io/badge/SciPy-654FF0?style=for-the-badge&logo=SciPy&logoColor=white)
![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pandas-2C2D72?style=for-the-badge&logo=pandas&logoColor=white)
![Matplotlib](https://img.shields.io/badge/Matplotlib-%23ffffff.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Matplotlib&logoColor=black)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

<p align="justify">
  I have had to learn numpy, scipy and matplotlib for reasons. There is just too many things that you simply cannot compute analytically, so numeric approach is needed. 
</p>

![Scikit](https://img.shields.io/badge/scikit_learn-F7931E?style=for-the-badge&logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=white)
![PyTorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyTorch-%23EE4C2C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=PyTorch&logoColor=white)
![Keras](https://img.shields.io/badge/Keras-%23D00000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Keras&logoColor=white)
![TensorFlow](https://img.shields.io/badge/TensorFlow-%23FF6F00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=TensorFlow&logoColor=white)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

<p align="justify">
  I have been learning a bit machine learning in the form of sklearn and PyTorch. I am definitely going to dig a little bit deeper in the world of machine learning in the future. TensorFlow have been on my radar for a while but the inspiration has not struck me just yet.
</p>

## Other Projects

<p align="justify">
  I have written a few game reviews in the past and few people have actually found them helpful. That encouraged me to make more reviews and that lead to an idea to review other stuff as well. I also got interested in an idea of writing other types of articles as well, like tutorials. However there are so much bad tutorials out there so I hesitated for a while. Still I decided to start a little blog. The following table contains a few of the articles I am quite proud of and could possibly even help someone out.

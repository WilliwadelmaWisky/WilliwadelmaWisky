  I'm a self-taught developer. I do programming as a hobby. I love creating all kinds of projects. 
  My interest in programing derives from the passion of playing video games.

## My Developer Journey

<p align="justify">
  At some point I became interested in mods while playing Ark Survival Evolved
  I wanted to make a mod myself so I began to search how does one make mods for ARK. I came across Ark Dev Kit, which was powered by Unreal Engine, and managed to make my own mod.
  Naturally my interests moved from the dev kit to the Unreal Engine itself and my journey as a "game developer" started.

### Game Development
![Unreal Engine](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Unreal%20Engine-313131?style=for-the-badge&logo=unreal-engine&logoColor=white)

<p align="justify">
  As mentioned already I began to learn Unreal Engine 4 with blueprints. I learned a lot of by making different small projects that never saw the light of day.
  However my inability to make something visually pleasing in 3D make me begin to lean towards 2D developement. 
  The tooling for 2D in Unreal Engine were quite limited at the time so naturally I started to look for better alternatives. 
  I came across Unity, of which I had heard of before, and started to learn how to build something with it.

![CSharp](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-239120?style=for-the-badge&logo=csharp&logoColor=white)

<p align="justify">
  To be able to build something with Unity, I first needed to learn C#. It was such a different experience from blueprints in Unreal. 
  Luckily C# syntax was very straight forward so I was able to understand it rather quickly. So I began building different 2D projects to learn the language better.
  I completely fell in love with C# and its statically typed language syntax. 
  After many attempts to finish a game, I always ended up losing interest in the projects due to the gameplay not being fun enough or the quality of the assets not being eye-pleasing enough.
  In the end I had a lot of unfinished projects but had learned so much. The experience with Unity and C# definitely opened many doors to learn different languages.
  My next destination was the web applications.

### Web Development

![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)

<p align="justify">
  At the start of my web application journey I came across a framework called React. 
  I also heard it was quite popular so I gave it a try. The syntax was a lot different than that of C#, especially with reqular javascript.
  I decided to go with typescript which was definitely a wise decision. A few little projects, todo etc., later I thought react is a little bit unnecessary for my use-case. 
  I began searching for another way. I decided to give another framework, called vue, a try because I heard people like it a lot more than react.

![VSCode](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual_Studio_Code-0078D4?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual%20studio%20code&logoColor=white)

<p align="justify">
  I started to build a little login/logoff application with vue. Very quickly I realized that, even though I liked vue quite a bit, also vue was a bit unnecessary.
  Then on I decided to steer away from frameworks to plain javascript.

  I also tried building desktop apps with python. However that did not go very smoothly and the reason wasn't even python itself, nor my inability to use it. 
  The problem was the ability to run python applications after making executables of them. 
  I found a lot of similar issues where windows defender blocks the execution and deletes the file afterwards.
  Luckily there was an easy fix for that, ditching windows entirely. 
  It was so worth it to switch to linux even though I was a bit scared to take a leap of faith and erase windows as I had never before installed an operating system before.

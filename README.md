  I'm a self-taught software developer and do programming as a hobby. 
  I love learning new things and creating all kinds of projects including games. 
  My interest in programing actually derives from the passion of playing video games. I wanted to learn how to make a game myself.

## My Developer Journey

<p align="justify">
  At some point I became interested in mods while playing Ark Survival Evolved.
  I wanted to make a mod myself so I began to search how does one make mods for ARK. I came across Ark Dev Kit, which was powered by Unreal Engine, and managed to make my own mod after trial and error.
  There was actually very little resources to learn how the dev kit works so I lost interest on it quite quickly, also the fact that the dev kit ran extremely slowly encouraged that.
  Naturally my interests moved from the dev kit to the Unreal Engine itself and my journey as a "game developer" started.
</p>

### Game Development
![Unreal Engine](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Unreal%20Engine-313131?style=for-the-badge&logo=unreal-engine&logoColor=white)

<p align="justify">
  As mentioned already I began to learn Unreal Engine 4 with blueprints. I learned a lot of by making different small projects that never saw the light of day.
  However my inability to make something visually pleasing in 3D make me begin to lean towards the 2D development. 
  The tooling for 2D in Unreal Engine was quite limited at the time so naturally I started to look for better alternatives. 
  I came across Unity, of which I had heard of before, and started to learn how to build something with it.
</p>

![Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unity-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=unity&logoColor=white)
![VisualStudio](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual_Studio-5C2D91?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual%20studio&logoColor=white)
![CSharp](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-239120?style=for-the-badge&logo=csharp&logoColor=white)

<p align="justify">
  Luckily there was a lot more learning material for Unity than for Unreal, so learning was not an issue.
  To be able to build something with Unity, I first needed to learn C#. It was such a different experience from blueprints in Unreal. 
  Luckily C# syntax was very straight forward so I was able to understand it rather quickly. So I began building different 2D projects to learn the language better.
  I completely fell in love with C# and its statically typed language syntax. 
  After many attempts to finish a game, I always ended up losing interest in the projects due to the gameplay not being fun enough or the quality of the assets not being eye-pleasing enough.
  In the end I had a lot of unfinished projects but had learned so much. The experience with Unity and C# definitely opened many doors to learn different languages.
  My next destination was the web applications.
</p>

### Web Development
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)
![Vue](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vue%20js-35495E?style=for-the-badge&logo=vuedotjs&logoColor=4FC08D)
![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)
![VSCode](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual_Studio_Code-0078D4?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual%20studio%20code&logoColor=white)
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)
![Javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E)

<p align="justify">
  At the start of my web application journey I came across a framework called React. 
  I also heard it was quite popular so I gave it a try. The syntax was a lot different than that of C#, especially with reqular javascript.
  I decided to go with typescript which was definitely a wise decision. A few little projects, todo etc., later I thought react is a little bit unnecessary for my use-case. 
  I began searching for another way. I decided to give another framework, called vue, a try because I heard people like it a lot more than react.
  I started to build a little login/logoff application with vue. Very quickly I realized that, even though I liked vue quite a bit, also vue was a bit unnecessary.
</p>

![JQuery](https://img.shields.io/badge/jquery-%230769AD.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=jquery&logoColor=white)
![VSCode](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual_Studio_Code-0078D4?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual%20studio%20code&logoColor=white)
![Javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E)

<p align="justify">
  Building something simple was a lot better to do with plain javascript than with react or vue for example.
  However plain javascript is a bit tedious and I image that is the main reason for choosing to use a framework.
  Luckily JQuery came to the rescue. I can keep my projects very simple and clean from all the boilerplate.

![Javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E)

<p align="justify">
  At some point I heard that it is possible to use react without nodejs. 
  I really like the legacy framework for it having a lot less boilerplate.
  It is also giving me a lot more control and understanding on what is actually happening.

### Desktop Applications
![Electron](https://img.shields.io/badge/Electron-2B2E3A?style=for-the-badge&logo=electron&logoColor=9FEAF9)
![VSCode](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual_Studio_Code-0078D4?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual%20studio%20code&logoColor=white)
![Javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E)

<p align="justify">
  A working application was quite simple to get up and running with electron+javascript. 
  However, in electron, wokring with for example a file system felt a little too complicated to my taste.
  I decided to search a different option. I came across Tauri.
</p>

![Tauri](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tauri-FFC131?style=for-the-badge&logo=Tauri&logoColor=white)
![VSCode](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual_Studio_Code-0078D4?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual%20studio%20code&logoColor=white)
![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white)

<p align="justify">
  However the problem with tauri was that I needed to learn rust. So I decided I would do just that and began learning rust.
  Rust was a very different experience from C# or javascript, and I little too complicated and messy to get something actually done.
  I decided to move away from web-based frameworks to java.

<p align="justify">
  Now I have been using java for developing desktop applications and have not really looked back.
  Java is also very similar to C# so there was not too much to learn about the syntax.
  If only java had operator overloading it would be amazing.
  Nonetheless I can get stuff done and I am happy about it.

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

<p align="justify">
  I also tried building desktop apps with python. However that did not go very smoothly and the reason wasn't even python itself, nor my inability to use it. 
  The problem was the ability to run python applications after making executables of them. 
  I found a lot of similar issues where windows defender blocks the execution and deletes the file afterwards.
  Luckily there was an easy fix for that, ditching windows entirely.

<p align="justify">
  I have been getting into computer graphics a little bit lately in the form of C++ and OpenGL.
  GLFW for windows and CMake as a build system make a quite a powerrful combination.

### Data Science and Numerics

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

<p align="justify">
  I have had to learn numpy, scipy and matplotlib for reasons. There is just too many things that you simply cannot compute analytically, so numeric approach is needed.
  Then later pandas and sklearn came into the picture as well. 
</p>

### Other Languages and Frameworks
<p align="justify">
  There are also a few other languages and frameworks I have used. 
  They did not quite fit the categories above so I had to create a separate section for them.
  The following table contains most of the important things.
</p>

| Language | Framework | Description |
|:---------|:----------|:------------|
| ![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/c-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white) | - | Done some super basic things in C to learn the syntax and to be able to understand C code a little bit if I see some. |
| ![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/go-%2300ADD8.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=go&logoColor=white) | - | Done an http server in go. |
| ![Javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E) | ![Leaflet](https://img.shields.io/badge/Leaflet-199900?style=for-the-badge&logo=Leaflet&logoColor=white) | Done a little bit of experimenting with the leaflet framework. |
| ![Kotlin](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kotlin-B125EA?style=for-the-badge&logo=kotlin&logoColor=white) | - | I tried kotlin to see if I liked it better than java. So far it is going to be java for me. |

### Plans for Future

<p align="justify">
  I am a linux enthusiast of sorts. As I already mentioned a little bit of moving from windows to linux. 
  It was probably the best decision I could have made. I only wish I had done it sooner. 
  The windows 10, the last ever windows, end of support announcement was the final straw for me.
  I may have had to sacrifice a few of the games I like but that is a cost I can live with.
  I actually liked windows 10 quite a bit apart from it updating always at the worst possible time and the constant usage of 4GB ram or more.

### IDEs and Editors
![IntelliJ](https://img.shields.io/badge/intellij_idea-000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=intellij-idea&logoColor=white)

![Sublime Text](https://img.shields.io/badge/sublime_text-%23575757.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=sublime-text&logoColor=important)
![Vim](https://img.shields.io/badge/VIM-%2311AB00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=vim&logoColor=white)

<p align="justify">
  I use intellij community edition for all my java projects. 
  I have also used eclipse in the past for java projects but I like intellij a lot more. 
  Of course kotlin support is a big bonus for me choosing the intellij.
  I use pycharm community edition on different python projects. If the project is bigger than a single python script I will use pycharm instead of vscode.
  I use sublime text for little tweaks. Also if I want to check the contents of a file sublime text is my prefered tool for that because it is fast and simple. 
  I used notepad++ in the past but switched to sublime text when I moved from windows to linux.
  I use vim for small tweaks. Also if I have to edit a file over ssh connection vim is my prefered tool for that. 
  I use vscode for most of my development needs.
</p>

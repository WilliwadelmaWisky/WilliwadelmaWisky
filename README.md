  I'm mostly a self-taught software developer and do programming as a hobby. I love learning new things and creating all kinds of projects including games. My interest in programing actually derives from the passion of playing video games. I wanted to learn how to make a game myself. I am also a linux user. I used to use windows in the past but decided to move to linux when the end of support of windows 10, "the last ever windows", was announced. Switching to linux was probably the best decision I could have made. I may have had to sacrifice a few of the games I like but that is a cost I can live with.

  I have also written a few game reviews in the past, and few people even found them helpful. That encouraged me to make more reviews and that lead to an idea of writing other types of articles as well, so I decided to start a little <a href="https://github.com/WilliwadelmaWisky/blog">blog</a>. The following table contains few of the articles someone might find useful.

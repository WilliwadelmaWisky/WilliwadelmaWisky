# My Developer Journey
<p align="justify">
  Many times I found myself wondering how amazing mods people have managed to build while playing video games. I had a little dream that maybe one day I would be able to build something like that as well. My interests in modding kept growing. Then one day while playing Ark Survival Evolved (modded) I decided to finally try to make a simple mod myself. I began searhing how does one make mods for ARK. I came across Ark Dev Kit, which was powered by Unreal Engine, and managed to make my own mod after trial and error. There was actually very little resources available on how the dev kit works at the time so I lost interest on it quite quickly. Also the fact that the dev kit ran extremely slowly on my machine encouraged that decision. Naturally my interests moved from the dev kit to the Unreal Engine itself, which was an engine to develop games, and so my journey as a "game developer" had started.

## Game Development
### Starting off with the already familiar Unreal Engine 4
![Unreal Engine](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Unreal%20Engine-313131?style=flat&logo=unreal-engine&logoColor=white)

<p align="justify">
  As mentioned already I began to learn Unreal Engine 4 with blueprints. Unreal Engine had many great starter kits for building different types of 3D games. I learned a lot of by making different small projects that never saw the light of day. However my inability to make something visually pleasing in 3D made me begin to lean towards the 2D development. The tooling for 2D in Unreal Engine was quite limited at the time. I had learned a lot of important skills from controlflow to basic script communication so I was confident to be able to use an actual programming language. I started to look for better alternatives for 2D development.
</p>

### Moving to Unity Engine for 2D tooling
![Unity Engine](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unity-111111.svg?style=flat&logo=unity&logoColor=white)

<p align="justify">
  I came across Unity Engine and started to learn how to build something with it. Luckily there was a lot more learning material for Unity than for Unreal, so learning was not an issue. I first needed to learn C# to be able to build something with Unity. It was such a different experience from blueprints in Unreal. Luckily C# syntax was very straight forward so I was able to understand it rather quickly. So I began building different 2D projects to learn the language better. I completely fell in love with C# and its statically typed language syntax. After many attempts to finish a game, I always ended up losing interest in the projects due to the gameplay not being fun enough or the quality of the assets not being eye-pleasing enough. In the end I had a lot of unfinished projects but had learned so much. I decided it was time to try something else than game development. The experience with Unity and C# definitely opened many more doors to learn different languages and frameworks.
</p>

### Trying out Godot
<p align="justify">
  There was some weirdness with runtime fees for awhile in the Unity Engine. I tried out Godot in the meantime if it was any good. I found out that Godot supported C# which was a big help since I did not need to start off by learning a new language. I only needed to learn a little bit on how the engine actually worked so I could build something with it. It was quite a bit different to Unity and I did not use Godot nearly long enough to make my mind if it is good or not. 
</p>

## Open-Source
![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/git-%23F05033.svg?style=flat&logo=git&logoColor=white)
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-%23121011.svg?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=white)

<p align="justify">
  During my time with Unity Engine I came across something called version control. After a little research I found a couple of different version control systems. I definitely found the most material about Git. So I began learning git a little bit and came across GitHub as well.
</p>

## Data Science
### Learning numerical approximation
![Numpy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Numpy-777BB4?style=flat&logo=numpy&logoColor=white)
![Scipy](https://img.shields.io/badge/SciPy-654FF0?style=flat&logo=SciPy&logoColor=white)

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

<p align="justify">
  Python has very good tools for working with numerics and creating plots or so I heard. I decided to try to learn NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib for that very reason. I obviously needed to learn how to use Python as well before I could take advantage over the libraries. I am very glad I did invest a lot of time to learn them because they are getting more and more useful for me everyday. In the past I used quite a bit of Excel (well the libreoffice alternative) when I needed to create a plot for some data for example because I did not know any better free alternatives. I probably have not touched Excel, for plotting data, even a single time after learning python and I am very glad about that. It is just a lot faster to work with Python and I have way more control over the results. I decided to to set my sight on the web development scene next.
</p>

### Learning optimization
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

<p align="justify">
  There are a lot of optimization tools in the SciPy library. I wanted to learn more on how they work under the hood. I started off with linear optimization.

## Web Development (Frontend)
### Learning how to build websites
![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=flat&logo=html5&logoColor=white)
![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=flat&logo=css3&logoColor=white)
![JQuery](https://img.shields.io/badge/jquery-%230769AD.svg?style=flat&logo=jquery&logoColor=white)
![Leaflet](https://img.shields.io/badge/Leaflet-199900.svg?style=flat&logo=Leaflet&logoColor=white)
![Javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=flat&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E)

<p align="justify">
  I wanted to build myself a simple static website. I found out that I needed to learn two new languages for that, HTML and CSS. Luckily the syntax of both languages was very straight forward so it did not take too long to learn the basics. I was able to make somewhat eye-pleasing results so I thought that maybe I should invest a little more time on learning frontend development. Some time later I began searching on how to render dynamic data on the website. I found out I needed to learn yet another new language, JavaScript. Javascript was such a weird language compared to C# but luckily it had little similarities to Python like the dynamic typing. I was able to understand enough to make something work without too many error message in the console. I decided to search if there was a better and easier way. Firstly I came across a library called a JQuery. It had many nice functions to shorten the repeating JavaScript code and was very easy to enable. I also came across something called TypeScript.
</p>

### NodeJS and the many Frameworks
![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=flat&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-2B2E3A.svg?style=flat&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)
![Vue](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vue-50ba62.svg?style=flat&logo=vuedotjs&logoColor=white)
![Angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/Angular-DD0031?style=flat&logo=angular&logoColor=white)
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=flat&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)

<p align="justify">
  I found out that instead of JavaScript I could use something called Typescript, which was looked a lot easier to understand than JavaScript. I began searching how can I actually use TypeScript. I came across something called NodeJS. Through node I also got introduced to the many different javascript frameworks and a tool called Vite. After doing a little reaserch on the internet I decided to try React. I heard it was quite popular and used in many large web applications. I decided to go with TypeScript which was super easy with Vite. A few little projects (todo-app, picture-gallery etc.) later I thought React is a little bit unnecessary for my small project ideas. I began searching for another simpler way. I decided to give another framework, called Vue, a try because I heard people like it a lot more than React. I started to build a little login-logoff application with Vue. Very quickly I realized that also Vue was unnecessary. I also gave Angluar a try but that was even worse for small projects. I turned back towards the vanilla JavaScript and JQuery for my small projects. During my reasearch on how to build something with the different frameworks I came across a term called a database and SQL.
</p>

### Databases and SQL
<p align="justify">
  One of the problems I faced during frontend development was that how can I store some data. I can't access the filesystem from the browser, hmmm. There was something called localstorage but that was not a very good option for persistent data. There was an another option: a database. I did spent some time learning SQL for communicating with databases. However I found that there were databases that did not require SQL as well. I definitely need to learn a little backend before working with external databases.
</p>

## Web Development (Backend)
### Learning how web servers work
![Flask](https://img.shields.io/badge/flask-111111.svg?style=flat&logo=flask&logoColor=white)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
![Golang](https://img.shields.io/badge/go-%2300ADD8.svg?style=flat&logo=go&logoColor=white)

<p align="justify">
  While experimenting with legacy React I noticed it did not work without a server. I needed to create an http server but I had no idea how to do that. I started to look for ways to create those and found that python has a quite simple http server built-in. I tried it, and it was very simple to get the server up and running. However I did not like that approach very much due to the nature of Python being a dynamically typed language. I wanted to work with a statically typed language so I began to search a more suitable option for my preferences. I came across GO of which I had never heard before. I immediately noticed some familiarity in the syntax between GO and C#. Naturally I was keen to give it a try. Quite quickly I realised that GO was becoming one of my favorite langauges and a lot better option for me than Python. Setting up an http server was incredibly simply. Later I came across Flask which is a Python web framework and a lot nicer to use than the built-in options. Flask definitely brought Python back on my list of possible candidates when building an http server.

<p align="justify">
  I also decided to try what Java had to offer. Java is very similar to C# so there was not too much to learn about the syntax. I came across a framework called Wicket. I did not have any specific project idea in mind so I just did some simple testing how the framework worked. Another framework I discovered was Spring. I definitely liked Spring a lot more than Wicket.

  My first taste of web-based desktop application frameworks was electron. A working application was quite simple to get up and running with electron + javascript. However, in electron, working with a file system, for example, felt a little too complicated to my taste. I decided to search a different and simpler option. An option I came across was a framework called Tauri. However the problem with tauri was that I needed to learn Rust. I had a little look on the internet what is this so called Rust language. I found out that it is very fastly evolving language and loved by many. I thought I will probably have to learn it someday anyway so I decided I might as well do it now and began learning rust. Rust was a very different experience from C# or javascript, and I little too complicated and messy to get something actually done. I decided to move away from web-based frameworks and to see what Python has to offer for building desktop applications.

  I tried building desktop apps with python (with windows). Working with virtual environments was a bit tedious as windows tried really hard to prevent me from using them. Luckily I managed to get it working with few commands. Another problem I faced was running the executables made from the python source code. Running the executables did not go smoothly at all as windows defender just blocks the execution and deletes the file afterwards. I found a lot of similar issues on the internet. Luckily there were a couple of easy fixes for that, either whitelisting the executable or ditching windows entirely.

## Linux

<p align="justify">
  I decided it was a time to move on to Linux due to a couple of reasons. Eversince the Windows 11 was introduced and Microsoft kept making questionable choices I knew I had to get rid of Windows at some point. I have not noticed any reasons why I would ever switch back to Windows after using a couple of Linux distributions for awhile. The only reason might be to get some multiplayer game working that has anticheat. Most of the software I need do have Linux alternatives or work through Wine just fine. However I have noticed a couple of apps that I have not managed to get working on Wine, so I can just run them through a virtual machine. A more detailed story of my switch from Windows 10 to linux can be found on my <a href="#">linuxjourney</a>.

  After using Linux I naturally got interested in building things to make me work more efficiently. I spent some time learning shell scripting and built some extremely simple helper scripts. I have also done more experimenting with the faster system programming languages and created some little libraries.

<p align="justify">
  I have been reading a little about computer graphics in the form of C++ and OpenGL. I decided that maybe I should try to build something with OpenGL as well. I came across CMake which makes compiling the C++ application very simple. Setting up a simple window was relatively easy to get working with GLFW. Probably the hardest part was to get the OpenGL working on my machine. Nonetheless I began building a very simple raytracer. The experience in learning C++ has been extremely rewarding, for example computer graphics is probably something I never would have come across otherwise because most game engines and frameworks have them built in already.

  I came across a term called functional programming. I did some reasearch and found out that functional programming supposedly quite difficult. I decided to give it a go. I started off with Common Lisp and Racket. Lisp has such a weird syntax but is actually quite simple after getting used to it. I also came across another functional programming language called Haskell. Functional languages are actually very genious since functions do not have any side effects, they can be used in parallel by default. Functional languages made me think differently and most definitely made me a better programmer.
